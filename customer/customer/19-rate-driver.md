<h1>How to rate my driver</h1>

At the end of each ride, you have an option in the app to rate your driver from one to five stars. Let us know your thought when riding with us at the end of the trip. 

You can also go to ride's history to rate bookings you haven't rate yet. The rate is available in your ride's receipt up to 72 hours.

> Please note your rating cannot be changed after you submit.

We will use your rating to assess and maintain drivers' quality as well as keep track of customer's satisfaction. As we would hardly respond to your ride feedback submission, please submit your support request {{fleetSupportemail}} if you have requests that need our attention.
