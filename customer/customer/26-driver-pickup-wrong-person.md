<h1> I wasn't picked up for my booking</h1>

A booking will be labelled **Cancelled** in the app when you or your driver cancels. You will not be charged the fare when ride is cancelled.

If the trip doesn't show as **Cancelled**, you can check with your family, friends or colleague who may have access to your **{{fleetName}}** account to make sure someone took the trip or you may have booked for other people.

Contact us at <a href="mailto:{{fleetSupportEmail}}">{{fleetSupportEmail}}</a> if you believe that you were charged for a trip that you did not take.
