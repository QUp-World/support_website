We will do our best to help you but we cannot guarantee that a driver has your item or can deliver it immediately to you.
Please note that neither we nor drivers are responsible for items left in a vehicle after a trip completes. For that reasons, we are unable to provide insurance, reimbursement, or replacement for items lost on a trip.
