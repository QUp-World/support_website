<h1>How to tip my driver</h1>

Tipping is optional but it is a way showing your appreciation to your driver. Soon after your trip completes, you have an option to tip with cash or through **{{fleetName}}** app.
Please note tipping follows your mode of payment selected for the trip so for cash-fare trips, you can only tip with cash.

### Add a tip when you pay

You can add the tip in the app soon after it completes. The total fare and receipt reflects the tip you add on the app.
