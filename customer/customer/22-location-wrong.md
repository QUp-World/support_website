<h1>My pickup or drop off location was wrong</h1>

If the pick-up location shown in the app is not where you actually are, we recommend you:
- Input an available location in the Google suggestion which is nearest to your actual pick-up then add the exact location in the note field to let drivers know. Check [this article](customer/11-change-booking-notes.md) to see how to add notes.
- Turn on **Share live location** so drivers would get to know the exact location you are. Head to [this article](customer/8-share-location.md) for more info about the "Share live location" option.

You can also chat to drivers after he accepts to communicate if the location displayed is incorrect. 
Learn how to chat with drivers at 
[this article](customer/7-contact-driver.md).

All your feedbacks and reports are welcome, please contact <a href="mailto:{{fleetSupportEmail}}">{{fleetSupportEmail}}</a> if you encounter any issues. Please provide exact addresses or street intersections you was picked up or dropped off.
