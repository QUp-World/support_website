<h1>I didn't receive verification codes</h1>

Identifying accounts by activation codes is a required step to ensure the security of your account.

Please take the following steps if you have trouble receiving verification codes

- Verification code is automatically sent to the phone number you input at the login page. Please make sure you input it correctly.
- **A verification is valid for 15 minutes**. Please make sure to enter the code soon after you receive it.
- If you don't receive any codes after a bit, you can tap **Resend codes** to get it sent again.

If none of the above works and no codes arrive to your phone number, please email us at <a href="mailto:{{fleetSupportEmail}}">{{fleetSupportEmail}}</a> and provide us with the registered phone number so we can help troubleshoot your problem.
