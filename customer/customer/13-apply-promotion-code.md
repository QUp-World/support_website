#### Add promotion codes to your account
Some promotions may automatically be applied to your account and show in **Promotions** tab. If a promotion code is valid for your account but not displaying in your **{{fleetName}}** account, please take the following steps to add it:

1. Open the **{{fleetName}}** app.
2. Tap the menu icon in the top-left corner.
3. Tap **Promotions** in the menu that appears.
4. Tap **Enter promo code** to type your code. Please note to check spelling.
5. Tap **Add** to finish.
After adding the code, you will see if the code is valid for your account. Each promo code will specify its value and expiration date.


Promotion codes added in **Promotions** tab will be automatically listed in **Promo** in the booking details for you to select.
