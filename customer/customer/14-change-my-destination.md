<h1>How to change my destination after the ride started</h1>

When you want to change your destination, you can check with the driver if he is fine with the change. Driver can help you update to the new destination or you can do that from your **{{fleetName}}** account.



Take the following steps to change destination from your app:
1. Go to the details of the booking you are onboard.
2. Tap the address of destination.
3. Enter the new destination.
4. Check the new fare.
5. Tap **Yes** to confirm the destination change.

Please note that the new fare will take into account of:
- the distance & duration you've already travelled;
- the new distance & duration required to travel.
