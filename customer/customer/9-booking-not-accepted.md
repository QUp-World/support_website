<h1>Why isn't my booking accepted</h1>

We appreciate your patience while we are searching a driver for you.
During peak hours or bad weather conditions, high demand may result in fewer available cars or drivers who are already committed to other passengers.

We are constantly improving our service by allocating more drivers to high-demand areas and we seek your kind understanding.

**Tips**:
- We recommend you try with another service type.
- Please try to reserve your ride when you already have plans. One of our driver will be allocated to your ride.
- Please make sure your device is in stable internet connection so that you get updated of your request.
