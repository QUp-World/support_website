<h1>Share my location</h1>

You can show your exact location to your drivers by turning on Share Location.

This feature helps your driver locate exactly where you are while you make your way to the pickup location.

> **Activate "Share Live Location"**

You can turn the feature on/off by tapping the location icon in the middle of the map screen as soon as when the driver starts on the way. You can just disable sharing your location anytime you wish.

<h4>How this works</h4>

When you activate this feature on the {{fleetName}} app, your driver will see an extra icon on their map showing where you are. The icon will disappear once your trip begins.
