<h2>Why do I receive no bookings?</h2>

If you do not get any bookings, please go through the guide below:

<h3>1. Check your connectivity</h3>

Open an Internet browser **(Google Chrome/Safari/etc)** to ensure your connection is running well. If it fails to perform, please resolve then try your {{fleetName}} Driver app again.

<h3>2. Check your status</h3>

Please make sure your account is **Available** ![N!Sodic](https://static-qup.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/gif/available.png).
Hit the button ![N|Sodic](https://static-qup.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/gif/unavailable.png) in case your status is Unavailable.

<h3>3. Your Credit Balance must be active</h3>

To receive cash-paid requests, your Credit Wallet balance must stay active (>RM5.0). If it is lower, please top-up deposit to continue your job activities.
