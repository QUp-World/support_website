<h2>Back-to-back Job</h2>

{{fleetName}} now helps you with more and more convenient jobs. Be ready to maximize your earnings with upcoming bookings!

<h3>How does Back-to-back order work?</h3>

While on-board, you are allowed to accept another request which is nearby your approaching drop-off point.

<h3>How do I handle the two bookings at a time?</h3>

The new request will be put in the waiting line. Once you complete the onboard booking as a usual process, the second one will be started with **Driver on the way** status. 

<h3>Are there any differences between earnings of back-to-back jobs and others?</h3>

No, there are no differences. Your drive will earn the same, regardless of normal bookings or back-to-back one.
