<h2>Location Inaccuracy</h2>

If you find that your app's location is different from the place you are standing, please try the following steps:

<h3>Step 1: Check your location via Google Maps</h3> 

If it does not match your current location, please uncover your phonecase and place the phone nearer the windscreen, and disable any battery saver settings.
  
Continue to the next step if the location is not rectified.        

<h3>Step 2: Enable Flightmode for 5 minutes then disable and check your location</h3> 

If location problem is not solved, it is probably due to the GPS hardware problems. Please repair/change to a new one.       

> **NOTE**: For Android users, modify your location mode setting can resolve this issue.
